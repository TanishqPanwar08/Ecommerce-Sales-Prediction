# E-commerce Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict e-commerce sales using machine learning techniques. The notebook performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training using several regression algorithms to forecast total sales.

## Features

- Data preprocessing, including label encoding of categorical variables and standardization of numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations to uncover insights into sales trends and delivery patterns.
- Feature engineering to optimize the dataset for model training.
- Implementation of various machine learning models: Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and a Voting Ensemble.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and RMSE.
- Visualization of model performance to compare the effectiveness of each approach.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `plotly`

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost plotly
